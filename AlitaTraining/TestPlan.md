# Test Plan for User Registration and Secure Login

## Project Specific Impact to Testing

### User Registration and Secure Login

**Project Phase:** Development and Testing

**Technology Stack:** 
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB

**Constraints and Assumptions:**
- The user registration and login functionality must be secure and follow industry best practices for authentication.
- The system should handle a large number of concurrent user registrations and logins without performance degradation.
- The registration process should include email verification to ensure the validity of user accounts.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- The user registration and login process should be seamless and user-friendly to enhance user experience.
- Security measures should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
- The system should be scalable to accommodate a growing user base.

**Project Geography:**
- Development and testing teams are located in different time zones (US and Europe), which may impact communication and coordination during testing phases.

## Test Planning Phase and Risk Management

### Test Planning Phase

#### Entry/Exit Criteria for Each Phase
- **Test Design Phase**
  - *Entry Criteria*: Requirement analysis completed, test environment set up, test data prepared
  - *Exit Criteria*: Test cases created and reviewed, test coverage identified

- **Test Execution Phase**
  - *Entry Criteria*: Test cases mapped to requirements, test environment ready, test data available
  - *Exit Criteria*: Test execution completed, defect reports raised and tracked

- **Test Reporting Phase**
  - *Entry Criteria*: Test execution completed, all defects resolved, test summary report ready
  - *Exit Criteria*: Test closure report approved, metrics collected and analyzed

#### Defects Severity Description
|| Severity || Meaning || Examples ||
| High | Critical issue impacting core functionality | System crash, data loss |
| Medium | Major issue affecting usability or performance | Incorrect calculations, slow response time |
| Low | Minor issue with minimal impact | Spelling errors, cosmetic issues |

### Risk Management

| Summary/ Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Exposure | Assignee | Treatment Strategy | Mitigation and/or Damage Control Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User data breach | High | High | High | Security team | Implement encryption, regular security audits | Monitor user data access, apply security patches regularly |
| Server downtime | Medium | High | Medium | IT team | Implement failover system, regular maintenance schedule | Monitor server performance, conduct load testing regularly |
| Inadequate user authentication | Medium | Medium | Low | Development team | Implement multi-factor authentication, regular code reviews | Conduct security testing, educate users on secure password practices |

## Quality and Acceptance Criteria

**Quality Objectives:**
- Ensure 100% test coverage for all user registration and login functionalities.
- Achieve a defect leakage rate of less than 2% post-release.
- Ensure all critical and high-severity defects are resolved before release.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All test cases must pass successfully.
- No open critical or high-severity defects.
- User registration and login functionalities must meet the specified performance benchmarks.

## Test Process Description

**Test Design:**
- Test cases will be designed based on the requirement specifications.
- Test data will be prepared to cover all possible scenarios, including edge cases.

**Test Execution:**
- Test cases will be executed in the test environment.
- Defects will be logged and tracked using the defect management tool.

**Test Reporting:**
- Test results will be documented and shared with stakeholders.
- A test summary report will be prepared at the end of the test cycle.

## Test Team

**Roles and Responsibilities:**
- **Test Manager:** Oversees the testing process, ensures resources are allocated, and communicates with stakeholders.
- **Test Lead:** Manages the test team, plans test activities, and ensures adherence to the test plan.
- **Test Engineers:** Design and execute test cases, log defects, and report test results.

**Stakeholders:**
