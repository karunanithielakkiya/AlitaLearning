# Test Plan: User Registration and Secure Login

## Project Specific Impact to Testing

**Project Description:**
The project involves implementing a user registration and secure login system for a platform that allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and access personalized features like order tracking and payment management. The system must adhere to security best practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Security: Encryption algorithms (e.g., bcrypt), CAPTCHA, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Constraints and Assumptions:**
- The application will utilize HTTPS for secure communication.
- Standard security protocols will be followed for user authentication.
- Integration with an email service is required for account verification and password reset.
- Backend support for encrypted password storage and MFA functionality is necessary.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Successful implementation of secure user registration and login functionality.
- Protection of user data through encryption and secure storage practices.
- Implementation of MFA to enhance account security.
- Resilience against common security threats like brute-force attacks.

**Project Geography:**
The project development team is located in different time zones, which may impact communication and coordination during testing phases. It is essential to ensure that testing activities are synchronized to accommodate team members in various locations.

**Execution:**
- Test the account creation process by providing valid email addresses and secure passwords.
- Verify that users receive a confirmation email with a verification link for account activation.
- Test the login functionality using registered email addresses and passwords.
- Ensure that passwords are securely stored using encryption algorithms.
- Test the password reset feature by requesting a reset link and verifying its expiration after 24 hours.
- Validate the Multi-Factor Authentication setup process and login verification.
- Perform security testing to check for vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
- Test the system's response to failed login attempts and account lockout after 5 failures within 10 minutes.
- Coordinate testing activities with team members in different time zones to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

| Inadequate MFA implementation | High | High | High | Development Team | Implement robust MFA mechanisms | Conduct regular MFA testing and user awareness training |

## Quality and Acceptance Criteria

- **Account Creation:**
  - Users can successfully create an account by providing a valid email address and a secure password.
  - An email with a verification link is sent to the user for account activation.
  - The user must click the link in the email to activate their account.

- **Login Functionality:**
  - Users should be able to log in using their registered email address and password.
  - Passwords must be stored securely using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
  - After successful login, users should be redirected to their account dashboard or homepage.

- **Password Reset:**
  - Users must be able to request a password reset link if they forget their password.
  - The reset link should expire after 24 hours.
  - After resetting the password, the user should be able to log in with the new credentials.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication:**
  - Users must be prompted to set up MFA after their first login.
  - The MFA verification should include a code sent to the userâ€™s email or phone.
  - The user must enter the MFA code to successfully complete the login process.

- **Security:**
  - The system must protect user data by encrypting sensitive information (e.g., passwords, email addresses) during registration, login, and in storage.
  - The login page should include protections against common security threats, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
