# Test Plan for User Registration and Secure Login

## 1. Project Specific Impact to Testing

- **Project Phase**: The project is in the development phase with the goal of implementing a user registration and secure login feature for a web application.
- **Technology Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for secure user data storage.
- **Constraints and Assumptions**: Strict deadline for feature release; backend APIs assumed to be properly implemented and integrated.
- **Critical Success Factors**: Secure data storage, robust authentication, seamless user experience.
- **Project Geography**: Development team in different time zones; clear communication channels needed.

## 2. Scope of Testing

### In Scope

| System/Component | Description | Responsible Side | Reference |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| User Registration Module | Allows new users to register by providing necessary details such as username, password, email, etc. | QA Team | User Registration Requirements Document |
| Secure Login Module | Ensures secure login using credentials. | QA Team | Secure Login Requirements Document |
| Password Recovery | Functionality to recover forgotten passwords through email verification. | QA Team | Password Recovery Requirements Document |
| Email Verification | Verification of user email addresses during registration. | QA Team | Email Verification Requirements Document |
| Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) | Additional security layer for user login. | QA Team | 2FA Requirements Document |

### Out of Scope

- Integration with third-party authentication services (e.g., Google, Facebook login)
- User profile management post-registration
- Backend database performance testing
- UI/UX design validation beyond functional aspects

### Third-Party Systems

- No third-party systems are included in this test plan.

### System Tested by Other Organizations

| System/Component | Description | Responsible Side | Reference |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| Backend Database | Stores user information. | Database Team | Database Design Document |
| Network Security | Ensures secure data transmission. | IT Security Team | Network Security Policy Document |

## 3. Quality and Acceptance Criteria

- **Account Creation**: Users can create an account with a valid email and secure password; receive a verification email.
- **Login Functionality**: Users can log in with registered credentials; passwords stored securely.
- **Password Reset**: Users can request a password reset link; reset link expires after 24 hours.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Users prompted to set up MFA after first login; MFA code required for login.
- **Security**: User data encrypted; protections against SQL injection and XSS; block login after 5 failed attempts.

## 4. Test Process Description

- **Test Design**: Create test cases based on requirements; review and approval by QA lead.
- **Test Execution**: Execute test cases; log defects; retest after fixes.
- **Test Reporting**: Generate test reports; include test coverage, defect density, and execution status.

## 5. Test Team

- **Roles and Responsibilities**:
  - QA Lead: Oversees testing process.
  - Test Engineers: Execute test cases, log defects.
  - Security Analyst: Focuses on security testing.

## 6. Test Schedule

- **Test Planning**: 1 week
- **Test Design**: 2 weeks
- **Test Execution**: 3 weeks
- **Test Reporting**: 1 week

## 7. Test Deliverables

- **Final Test Report**: Comprehensive report including test metrics and outcomes.

## 8. Test Planning Phase and Risk Management

- **Entry/Exit Criteria for Each Phase**:
  - **Test Design Phase**: Entry - Requirement analysis completed; Exit - Test cases created and approved.
  - **Test Execution Phase**: Entry - Test cases ready; Exit - Test execution completed, defects reported.
  - **Test Reporting Phase**: Entry - Test execution completed; Exit - Test report generated.

- **Defects Severity Description**:
  - **High**: Critical issue impacting core functionality.
  - **Medium**: Major issue affecting usability or performance.
  - **Low**: Minor issue with minimal impact.

- **Risk Management**:
  - **Data Breach**: High probability and impact; enhance encryption, conduct audits.
  - **Server Downtime**: Medium probability and impact; implement redundancy, monitor health.
